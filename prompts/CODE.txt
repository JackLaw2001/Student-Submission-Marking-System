Please evaluate the student's code and 'README.md' based on these scoring criteria:
1. README.md is not a blank file and contains information on how to use a program
2. Included comments in code
Each of the above two scoring points is worth one point.

Score each of the two criteria out of 1 point. RETURN ONLY THE SCORES FOR EACH SECTION IN A COMMA-SEPARATED FORMAT, WITHOUT ANY EXTRA INFORMATION. For example, if the student scores 1 and 0, simply return: 1,0.

The code is as follows:
{CODE}

The 'README.md' is as follows:
{README}

Please evaluate the student's code and directory structure diagram based on these scoring criteria:
1. completed 3 panda related sections i.e. visual/window, scenery and panda (3 marks)
2. A Multi-Media experience (1 mark)
The first scoring point is worth three points, the second scoring point is worth one point.

The assignment is to design an animation using the panda3D game engine. For the first point, students can get points if the final animation contains visual/window (1 mark), scenery (1 mark) and panda (1 mark).
For the second point, students can get one point as long as they use audio in their program.

Score each of the two criteria out of 1 point. RETURN ONLY THE SCORES FOR EACH SECTION IN A COMMA-SEPARATED FORMAT, WITHOUT ANY EXTRA INFORMATION. For example, if the student scores 3 and 0, simply return: 3,0.

The code is as follows:

The directory structure diagram is as follow:
